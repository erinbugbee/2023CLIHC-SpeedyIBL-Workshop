        "There were 4 decks of cards (A, B, C, and D).\n",
        "\n",
        "Participants had to choose in total 100 cards, one at the time.\n",

        "Participants did not know what each card would yield in advance (i.e., like a lottery).\n",
        "\n",
        "Participants started with a \"loan\" of $2000 and were told to make a profit.\n",
        "\n",
