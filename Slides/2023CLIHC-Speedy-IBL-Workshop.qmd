# Introduction to Instance-Based Learning Theory

## Complex, Dynamic Decision Making (DDM)

:::

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 25px;"}
-   Dynamic and sequential multi-attribute decisions that are interdependent over-time

<!-- -->

-   High uncertainty and change at different time scales 

-   Dynamic allocation of limited resources (time, drones, people)

-   There is not enough time for considering all alternatives before making a choice

-   Human cognitive abilities (attention, memory) are limited

## Machine AI and Complex Societal DDM Problems

::: columns

:::

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 25px;"}
-   Machine AI is supporting complex DDM problems in multiple ways --- aggregating data, detecting patterns, and forecasting and projecting events based on data
-   But often there is not enough data, particularly regarding high-level decisions
    -   Requires a deep understanding of context, consideration of multiple and possibly conflicting factors and their consequences

    -   The incorporation of ethical and moral trade-offs

*Artificial intelligence has two goals.*

*First, AI is directed toward getting computers to be smart and do smart things so that human beings don't have to do them.*

*And second, AI (sometimes called cognitive simulation, or information processing psychology) is also directed at using computers to simulate human beings, so that we can **find out how humans work and perhaps can help them to be a little better in their work.***

## Representation of Decisions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 30px;"}
-   Decisions are stored over-time in memory (**Instances**) consisting of **Contextual features, Action, Outcome (Utility)**

-   For each potential Action i**nstances are Blended** accounting for similarity, to create an **expected utility**

-   The Action with the **highest Blended Value** is executed, and new instances are created.

-   The **Blended Value is updated** with an experienced outcome through **feedback**

:::

```{python}
#| eval: false
pip install -U speedyibl
```
:::

![](images/install.png)

## Installing SpeedyIBL Library

conda activate myenv
pip install -U speedyibl	
```
:::

## An IBL Agent with SpeedyIBL

### Import the class `Agent` from `speedyibl`

```{python}
from speedyibl import Agent
```

![](images/agent.png){fig-align="center"}

## Attributes (properties) of the class `Agent`

![](images/inputs.png){fig-alt="Description of inputs of the class Agent"}

### To view the list of attributes:

```{python}

help(Agent.__init__)
```

## Functions (methods) of the class `Agent`

![](images/functions.png){fig-alt="Functions of the class Agent"}

### To display the list of methods:

```{python}
dir(Agent)
vars(Agent)
```

## SpeedyIBL for Binary Choice Task

![](images/binary_choice.png){fig-align="center"}

## Notebook: [*02_Exercise_BinaryChoice.ipynb*](https://github.com/DDM-Lab/2023CLIHC-SpeedyIBL-Workshop/blob/solution/02_Exercise_BinaryChoice.ipynb)

### The Binary Choice Task

![](images/binary_cycle.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Choose one of two options: **Option A** or **Option B**

    -   One option is **SAFE,** always yielding a fixed medium outcome (3)

    -   One option is **RISKY,** yielding a high outcome (4) with probability of 0.8, and a low outcome (0) with the complementary probability of 0.2

-   **Single-state** with **immediate** feedback task

## Create an Environment for the Binary Choice Task

![](images/environment.png){fig-align="center"}

### Defining Options

::: {#options}
::: nonincremental
-   Define a list of options for the agent to choose

```{python}
#| eval: false
options = ['A', 'B'] # A is the safe option while B is the risky one
```
:::
:::

### Defining Reward

::: {#reward}
::: nonincremental
-   Define the reward for choosing an option
:::

```{python}
#| eval: false
import random

def reward(choice):
  if choice == 'A':
    r = 3
  elif random.random() <= 0.8:
    r = 4
  else:
    r = 0
  return r
```
:::

### Putting Together in Class `BinaryChoice`

```{python}
import random 

class BinaryChoice:
  def __init__(self):
    self.options = ['A', 'B']
    
  def reward(self, choice):
    if choice == 'A':
      r = 3
    elif random.random() <= 0.8:
      r = 4
    else:
      r = 0
    return r
```

### Declare an Environment

```{python}
env = BinaryChoice()
```

### Building an Agent for the Binary Choice Task

Create an IBL agent for the binary choice task:

::: {#build}
::: nonincremental
-   Indicating a value of `default_utility`

```{python}
from speedyibl import Agent

agent = Agent(default_utility = 4.4)
```

-   Indicating values for parameters, e.g. `noise` and `decay`

```{python}
#| eval: false
agent = Agent(default_utility = 4.4, noise = 0.1, decay = 0.8)
```
:::
:::

## Interactions Between the Agent and the Task: Actions

![](images/interactions.png){fig-align="center"}

### Choose Option

-   Make the agent choose one of two options:

```{python}
choice = agent.choose(env.options)
```

## Interactions Between the Agent and the Task: Observations and Rewards

![](images/interactions_obs_rewards.png){fig-align="center"}

### Observe Reward

::: {#respond}
::: nonincremental
-   After choosing one option, the agent observes the reward and stores an instance in memory using the function `respond`:
:::

```{python}
r = env.reward(choice)
agent.respond(r)
```
:::

### View the Agent's Memory

::: {#instances}
::: nonincremental
-   To see how instances are stored in the memory
:::

```{python}
agent.instances()
```
:::

-   Example:

![](images/memory.png){fig-align="center"}

## IBL Agent's Decision Mechanisms

### Activation of Each Instance

```{python}
print(agent.CompActivation(agent.t+1, 'A'))
print(agent.CompActivation(agent.t+1, 'B'))
```

### Probability of Retrieving Each Instance

```{python}
print(agent.CompProbability(agent.t+1, "A"))
print(agent.CompProbability(agent.t+1, "B"))
```

### Blended Value for Each Option

```{python}
print(agent.CompBlended(agent.t+1, env.options))
```

### Simulating Choices for Many Rounds

-   Let the agent play 100 rounds (trials) for the binary choice task
    -   Each round includes *choosing* one option, *observing* the reward, and *storing* the instance

![](images/rounds.png){fig-align="center"}

### Simulating Choices for Many Rounds: Code

::: {#simulation}
```{python}
rounds = 100 # number of rounds (trials)
pmax = []
for i in range(rounds):
  choice = agent.choose(env.options) # choose one option from the list of options
  r = env.reward(choice) # observe the reward
  agent.respond(r) # store the instance
  pmax.append(choice == 'B')
  
print(f"P(Max): {sum(pmax)/rounds}")
```
:::

### Simulating Choices for Many Runs

-   Let's have 500 runs (500 subjects) playing 100 rounds of the task

![](images/runs.png){fig-align="center"}

### Simulating Choices for Many Runs: Code

```{python}
#| class-source: small_code
#| classes: small_code

runs = 500
rounds = 100 # number of rounds (trials)
pmax_per_run = []
for j in range(runs):
  pmax = []
  agent.reset() # clear the memory for a new run
  for i in range(rounds):
    choice = agent.choose(env.options) # choose one option from the list of options
    r = env.reward(choice) # observe the reward
    agent.respond(r) # store the instance
    pmax.append(choice == 'B')
  pmax_per_run.append(pmax)
```

### Plotting Performance (PMAX) over Rounds

```{python}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-width: 2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 3.5))
plt.plot(range(rounds), np.mean(pmax_per_run,axis=0), color='darkgreen',
          markersize=2, linestyle='--', label='speedyIBL')
plt.xlabel('Round')
plt.ylabel('PMAX')
plt.title('Performance')
plt.ylim(0,1)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Exercise 1

-   Simulate the effect of the IBL model inputs in the Binary Choice Task

    -   `default_utility` of 3, `noise` of 0.25, and `decay` of 0.5

    -   `default_utility` of 4.4, `noise` of 0.5, and `decay` of 0.8

## Exercise 2

-   The table below from [@hertwig2004] presents the proportion of maximization obtained from experimentation in **Humans**

    -   Simulate the Problem 5

    -   Compare the IBL agents' PMAX vs. Humans' PMAX (Pmax2 column)

# Building an IBL Model for the Iowa Gambling Task

## Iowa Gambling Task History

-   Developed by researchers to study risky decision making [@bechara1994]

-   Widely used to study human cognition

## Iowa Gambling Task Demo

::: {#igt}
::: nonincremental
-   To play the demo of game: <https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/igt.html>

-   4 decks of cards (A, B, C, and D).

-   Participants started with a "loan" of \$2000 and were told to make a profit.
:::

![](images/iowa1.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}
:::

. . .

## Iowa Gambling Task: Choices

::: {#igt2}
::: nonincremental
-   Participants had to choose 100 cards in total, one at the time. Each time they choose a card, they get feedback about winning and/or losing some money.

-   They did not know what each card would yield in advance (i.e., a lottery).

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/iowa3.png){fig-align="center" width="302"}
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Task Environment

-   Decks A and B always yielded \$100

-   Decks C and D always yielded \$50

-   For each card chosen, there is a 50% chance of having to pay a penalty as well. For decks A and B, the penalty is \$250, whereas for decks C and D it is \$50.

# Conclusion

## Additional Applications

## Gridworld

-   A sequential decision making problem wherein a decision maker navigates through a grid by making sequential decisions about which actions to take (Up, Down, Left, Right) to search for a target and avoid obstacles

    -   Dimension of environment: 3 x 4 grid that contains an obstacle (black cell)

    -   Decision maker starts at an initial position (marked Start) and has a 25-step limit

    -   One target which yields 1 point if the decision maker found it

## IBL Model for Gridworld Environment

::: nonincremental
-   Delayed feedback as a result of sequence of choices as opposed to a single choice
:::

<div>

```{python}
#| eval: false
agent.equal_delay_feedback(reward, episode_history)
```

</div>

## Ms. Pacman from GymAI

<div>

<div>

::: nonincremental

import gym

env = gym.make('MsPacman-v0')
```
